# Bone Age Estimation from Hand Radiographs

An **end-to-end deep learning pipeline** for estimating bone age from left-hand X-rays by integrating object detection, medical image segmentation, and regression modeling.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Bone age estimation is a crucial task in pediatric radiology for assessing growth and diagnosing endocrine or developmental disorders.  
This project implements a **hybrid deep learning and classical modeling pipeline** that:
- Detects regions of interest (ROIs) in X-rays
- Segments bone structures
- Extracts clinically relevant features
- Maps them to age predictions via regression models  

The approach outperforms many existing automated bone age estimation methods.

## âœ¨ Features
- **ROI Detection with YOLOv8**  
  Trained on 300 X-rays to detect 5 anatomical regions of interest.
- **Bone Segmentation with UNet++**  
  Custom-trained (100 annotated X-rays) for accurate bone masking.
- **Preprocessing**  
  - Bone orientation standardization (joint alignment + angle correction)  
  - ROI extraction using bounding boxes  
  - Edge refinement using Canny edge detection
- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Extracted bone width ratios (32 key points per ROI)  
  - Polynomial regression per ROI
- **Final Age Estimation**  
  Averaging outputs of ROI-specific models for robustness
- **Evaluation**  
  Achieved **MAE = 6.28 months** and **RMSE = 7.23 months** on 1800+ X-rays  
  (Normalized MAE = 0.0467, Normalized RMSE = 0.0538)
